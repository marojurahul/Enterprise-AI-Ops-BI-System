# Enterprise AI-Ops & Business Intelligence System
**Status:** Operational | **Tier:** Enterprise Architecture | **Day:** 37

## 🚀 Executive Summary
An end-to-end autonomous pipeline that transforms unstructured multi-source data (Telegram/Drive) into structured Business Intelligence. This system utilizes a **RAG-first approach** for deep reasoning and a **JSON-schema bridge** for high-integrity Power BI reporting.

## 🏛️ System Architecture
- **Intelligence:** n8n + OpenAI (Agentic reasoning with RAG)
- **Monitoring (Sentinel):** Automated Global Error Handling via Telegram Admin Bot.
- **Data Layer:** Structured JSON Output Parser -> Google Sheets API.
- **Visualization:** Power BI Desktop (Real-time Risk & Sentiment Analytics).

## 🛠️ Key Features (Day 37 Updates)
### 1. The "Telegram Sentinel"
Developed a global observability layer. If an API fails or a token expires, the system self-diagnoses and alerts the administrator instantly, maintaining 99.9% uptime logic.

### 2. Validated Schema Bridge
Implemented strict JSON Output Parsing. This ensures that the data flowing into Power BI is always clean, preventing dashboard crashes and ensuring data-type consistency for DAX measures.
